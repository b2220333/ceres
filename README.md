Ceres is *not actively maintained*.

Ceres is a component of [Graphite][] as one of the time-series storage options available for use.
Ceres provides a file format for incoming metrics to be persisted when received from the network.

## Overview

Ceres is a time-series database format intended to replace [Whisper][] as the default storage
format for [Graphite][]. In contrast with Whisper, Ceres is not a fixed-size database and is
designed to better support sparse data of arbitrary fixed-size resolutions. This allows Graphite
to distribute individual time-series across multiple servers or mounts.

Expected features such as roll-up aggregation and data expiration are not provided by Ceres itself,
but instead are implemented as maintenance plugins in [Carbon][].
